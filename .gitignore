# Large data files / Models - these should be downloaded by users as per instructions
# coqui-tts-api/coqui-models-data/ # This is already handled by being a submodule or downloaded on demand
# coqui-tts-api/speaker-wavs/*.wav # If users add their own, they might not want to commit them.
# coqui-tts-api/speaker-wavs/*.mp3 # However, the example Wj0v.wav should be kept.
# A more specific rule could be to ignore all wav/mp3 in speaker-wavs except the example.
# For now, let users manage their own speaker files. If Wj0v.wav is an example, it should be committed.

# If there are other specific build artifacts or large files, add them here.
